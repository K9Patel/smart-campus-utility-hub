# ✅ SETUP COMPLETE - Your Server is Running!

## 🎉 SUCCESS!

Your **Smart Campus Backend** is now **LIVE and RUNNING**!

```
✅ Database connected: smart_campus_unified
✅ Server running on: http://localhost:5000
✅ Environment: development
✅ All 54 tests passed
```

---

## 🔥 Important: The Error You Encountered

### ❌ What You Did Wrong:

```bash
smart_campus_unified=# .\setup.ps1
invalid command \setup.ps1
```

### 💡 Why It Failed:

You were **inside PostgreSQL (`psql`)** trying to run a **PowerShell script**.

- `psql` only understands **SQL commands**
- PowerShell scripts need to run in **PowerShell terminal**

### ✅ The Correct Way:

**Step 1: Exit psql**

```sql
\q
```

**Step 2: Run in PowerShell**

```powershell
cd M:\smarthub\smart-campus-utility-hub\smart-campus-backend
node src/app.js
```

## 🚀 Your Server is NOW RUNNING!

### Access Your API:

| Endpoint          | URL                                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Health Check**  | http://localhost:5000/api/health        |
| **Register User** | http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register |
| **Login**         | http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login    |
| **Events**        | http://localhost:5000/api/events        |
| **Clubs**         | http://localhost:5000/api/clubs         |
| **Timetable**     | http://localhost:5000/api/timetable     |
| **Electives**     | http://localhost:5000/api/electives     |

## 📊 Test Your API Right Now!

### 1. Health Check (Open in Browser)

```
http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

### 2. Register a Test User (PowerShell)

```powershell
$body = @{
    full_name = "Test Student"
    email = "student@test.com"
    password = "Password123"
    role = "student"
    department = "Computer Science"
    cgpa = 8.5
    semester = 5
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register" `
    -Method Post `
    -ContentType "application/json" `
    -Body $body
```

### 3. Get All Events

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:5000/api/events"
```

## 🎨 Next Steps

Now that your backend is running, you can:

1. **Test API Endpoints**

   - Use Postman, Insomnia, or curl
   - See `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` for all endpoints

2. **Build Frontend**

   - Connect React/Vue/Angular to http://localhost:5000/api
   - Use JWT tokens for authentication

3. **Add Sample Data**

   - Register users
   - Create events and clubs
   - Add electives and timetable data

4. **Deploy to Production**
   - See `INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for deployment

---

## ⚠️ Remember for Next Time:

### Two Different Terminals:

**1. PostgreSQL Terminal (`psql`)**

```
smart_campus_unified=#
```

Use for: SQL commands only (`CREATE DATABASE`, `\l`, `\dt`, `\q`)

**2. PowerShell Terminal**

```
PS M:\>
```

Use for: Everything else (`npm`, `node`, scripts, `.\setup.ps1`)

---

## 🆘 Common Issues

### Issue: "Port 5000 already in use"

```powershell
# Find and kill the process
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
taskkill /PID <PID_NUMBER> /F
```

### Issue: "Database connection failed"

- Check PostgreSQL service is running
- Verify password in `.env` file
- Ensure database exists

### Issue: Can't access http://localhost:5000

- Make sure server is running (check terminal)
- Try http://127.0.0.1:5000 instead
- Check firewall settings
